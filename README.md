# **GenX - Token Mining & Airdrop Manager**

Welcome to **GenX**, an innovative platform designed for token mining, airdrop management, and gamified rewards, built on the Near Blockchain. This README will guide you through setting up the project and getting it up and running in no time!

---

## 🛠️ **Getting Started**

To begin with **GenX**, you’ll need to have the project up and running locally. Follow the steps below to initialize everything and get started on your journey of blockchain-powered rewards.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/genx.git
cd genx
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**

Ensure you have **Node.js** (version 16 or higher) installed on your machine. If not, [download it here](https://nodejs.org/).

Then, run the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all necessary packages for the backend, frontend, and blockchain components.

### **3. Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and populate it with the required variables. Example:

```bash
NEAR_API_KEY=your-near-api-key
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
PORT=3000
```

These variables will configure your blockchain interaction, database connections, and server settings.

### **4. Start the Development Server**

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are set up, you’re ready to start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). 🎉

## ⚙️ **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** React, Chakra UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Blockchain:** Near Blockchain (JavaScript Smart Contracts)
- **Database:** MongoDB (for user data and rewards tracking)

---

## 🔄 **Blockchain Setup**

For testing blockchain functionality locally, run the following command to initialize your blockchain environment:

```bash
npm run setup-blockchain
```

This will set up the local Near environment for token distribution, airdrop management, and smart contract deployment.

---

## 📝 **Running Tests**

To ensure everything is working smoothly, run the tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will execute all the unit tests for the token mining logic, airdrop management, and leaderboard systems.

## 🎨 **Personalize Your Experience**

The **GenX** platform has a rich, mythological-themed design with a progression system based on the Yugas. You can personalize the user experience by modifying the colors and adding new badges or tokens in the **src/config** folder.



## 🚀 **Next Steps**

Once you’ve got your development environment running, you can start exploring the exciting world of token mining, airdrop campaigns, and gamified rewards. Build your community, manage your rewards, and watch your tokens grow!
